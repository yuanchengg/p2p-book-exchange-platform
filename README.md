BookLives is a Peer-to-Peer Book Exchange Platform. It is a platform which **gives books a second life.** This idea was formed when we recognized that books no longer read by someone could be a treasure for someone else, and this platform aims to make book exchange **as easy as clicking a button**, ensuring books find new readers who appreciate them. BookLives also **promotes a culture of *sharing and sustainability*, *reducing waste*, and fostering a community of readers who can *benefit from each other's* collections**.

# Sprint 1: Proof of Concept
User stories:
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign up and login.

3. As a user, I want to be able to log out of the system so that my data is safe.

# Sprint 2: User Reviews and Ratings
Objective: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for books and other users.
1. As a user, I want to leave a review and rating for a book after completing an exchange so I can share my feedback with others.
2. As a user, I want to see the average rating and recent reviews on a book listing page so I can make informed decisions before requesting an exchange.
3. As an admin, I want to moderate reviews flagged as inappropriate so the platform remains safe and respectful.

# Sprint 3: Messaging System
Objective: Enable users to chat within the platform to negotiate exchanges, providing a seamless communication channel.
1. As a user, I want to send messages to another user when interested in their listed book so I can negotiate an exchange.
2. As a user, I want to view my message history so I can continue conversations about exchanges.
3. As a user, I want to receive notifications for new messages so I donâ€™t miss opportunities for exchanges.

# Sprint 4: AI-Powered Recommendations
Objective: Use machine learning to recommend books based on user preferences, past exchanges, and browsing history.
1. As a user, I want personalized book recommendations based on my past exchanges and genres of interest so I can discover new books easily.
2. As a user, I want to view trending books on the platform so I can explore popular listings.
3. As a backend engineer, I want to gather user activity data (searches, clicks, exchanges) to train and refine the recommendation algorithm.

Objective: Allow users to scan barcodes to quickly add book details while listing.
1. As a user, I want to scan a barcode on the book so I can list it quickly.
